# Expense Tracker
- Objective is to create an app that helps us to manage our transactions (ingoings and outgoings) and also provides us with a savings balance using vanilla JavaScript, as part of [Glovo Women in Tech Bootcamp](https://keepcoding.io/nuestros-bootcamps/mujeres-glovo/)

Necessary requirements:
- The app should continuously show our expenses, income and savings
- We can add a transaction (ingoing or outgoing) including a description 
- We can delete whichever transaction that we've inputted
